# NeuralNetwork
First and small neural network implemented, for fun, in C.

Branch master is the only one currently working, it is an attempt to implement a multiple linear regressor and it will be update soon.

It uses 4 nodes divided in two layer and it is capable of working with application such ax + by = k.
